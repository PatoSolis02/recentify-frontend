# Frontend Structure and Component Separation

To improve maintainability, readability, and scalability, the frontend React code was refactored into multiple files/components:

- **Separation of Concerns:** Each file/component is responsible for a specific part of the UI or logic. This makes it easier to understand, debug, and update each part independently.
- **Reusability:** Components like `PlaylistManager` can be reused or extended in other parts of the app or in future features.
- **Cleaner Main Component:** The main `Welcome.jsx` file is now focused on authentication, user state, and high-level logic, while delegating playlist management to its own component.
- **Easier Testing:** Smaller, focused components are easier to test in isolation.
- **Scalability:** As the app grows, new features or UI sections can be added as new components without cluttering the main files.

## Structure

- `Welcome.jsx`: Handles authentication, user state, and passes playlist-related state/handlers to `PlaylistManager`.
- `PlaylistManager.jsx`: Handles all playlist creation/editing UI and logic.

This modular approach is a best practice in React development and will help keep the codebase clean and manageable as the project evolves.
